				</header>
				<p>
					Republic Act No. 8353, also known as the "Anti-Rape Law of 1997," was enacted to redefine and broaden the
					legal definition of rape in the Philippines. Under this law, rape is no longer classified as a crime against
					chastity but as a crime against persons, recognizing the physical and psychological harm it inflicts on
					victims. This shift in definition signifies a major legal reform, emphasizing that rape is a violation of
					personal dignity and autonomy.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4">
					The law also expands the circumstances under which rape can be committed. It recognizes that rape can occur
					not only through the use of force, intimidation, or threats but also when the victim is deprived of reason,
					unconscious, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Additionally, it includes cases where a victim is
					unable to give consent due to mental disability or in situations of marital rape, thereby addressing a wider
					scope of sexual violence.
				</p>
				<p className="mt-4">
					RA 8353 emphasizes strict penalties for offenders, including life imprisonment for those found guilty of the
					crime. It aims to protect victims and provides them with legal avenues to seek justice while holding
					perpetrators accountable. The law reflects the Philippines' commitment to combating sexual violence and
					supporting the rights of survivors.
