			<p>
				Republic Act No. 8353, also known as the "Anti-Rape Law of 1997," was enacted to redefine and broaden the legal
				definition of rape in the Philippines. Under this law, rape is no longer classified as a crime against chastity
				but as a crime against persons, recognizing the physical and psychological harm it inflicts on victims. This
				shift in definition signifies a major legal reform, emphasizing that rape is a violation of personal dignity and
				autonomy.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				The law also expands the circumstances under which rape can be committed. It recognizes that rape can occur not
				only through the use of force, intimidation, or threats but also when the victim is deprived of reason,
				unconscious, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Additionally, it includes cases where a victim is
				unable to give consent due to mental disability or in situations of marital rape, thereby addressing a wider
				scope of sexual violence.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				RA 8353 emphasizes strict penalties for offenders, including life imprisonment for those found guilty of the
				crime. It aims to protect victims and provides them with legal avenues to seek justice while holding
				perpetrators accountable. The law reflects the Philippines' commitment to combating sexual violence and
				supporting the rights of survivors.
