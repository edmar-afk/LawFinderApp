			<p>
				Republic Act No. 7877, also known as the "Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995," was enacted to address and
				prevent sexual harassment in the workplace, educational institutions, and training environments. The law defines
				sexual harassment as any unwanted or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or any other verbal
				or physical conduct of a sexual nature, particularly when it affects an individual's employment, work
				performance, or educational standing. It recognizes the power dynamics involved, particularly when the harasser
				is in a position of authority over the victim.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				The law emphasizes that sexual harassment can occur between superiors and subordinates, teachers and students,
				or trainers and trainees. It applies to acts committed in workplaces, schools, or any place where authority is
				exercised. RA 7877 holds employers, school administrators, and supervisors responsible for preventing and
				addressing incidents of harassment. Institutions are required to develop policies and procedures to handle
				complaints, investigate cases, and provide protection for victims.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				Violators of RA 7877 face administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment or fines,
				depending on the severity of the offense. By enacting this law, the Philippines made a significant step toward
				creating safer environments, promoting gender equality, and protecting individuals from sexual harassment and
				abuse of power in professional and educational settings.
