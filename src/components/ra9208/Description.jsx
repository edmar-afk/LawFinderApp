			</header>
			<p>
				Republic Act No. 9208, also known as the "Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003," was enacted to prevent,
				suppress, and punish human trafficking, particularly women and children. The law defines trafficking in persons
				as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons through coercion, fraud,
				deception, or abuse of power for the purpose of exploitation. This includes forced labor, slavery, sexual
				exploitation, prostitution, and the removal of organs.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				The law imposes severe penalties on traffickers and anyone involved in facilitating or assisting in human
				trafficking activities. It specifically prohibits the recruitment and trafficking of persons for exploitative
				purposes, whether done within or outside the country. The law also targets individuals who profit from
				trafficking, such as those who use trafficked persons for commercial exploitation, and it provides protection to
				victims, offering them legal assistance, shelter, and rehabilitation.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				RA 9208 also mandates the cooperation of various government agencies, such as the Department of Social Welfare
				and Development (DSWD) and law enforcement, to combat human trafficking effectively. The law promotes national
				and international cooperation to prevent trafficking and ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice,
				reflecting the Philippines' commitment to eradicating human trafficking and protecting vulnerable populations.
