			<p>
				Republic Act No. 7610, also known as the "Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and
				Discrimination Act," was enacted to safeguard children from all forms of abuse and exploitation. The law
				recognizes that children are particularly vulnerable and therefore deserve special protection from violence,
				neglect, cruelty, and exploitation, including sexual and economic abuse. It establishes specific provisions to
				prevent child labor, prostitution, trafficking, and other harmful practices.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				The law defines acts of child abuse as those causing harm or potential harm to the child’s physical, emotional,
				or mental health. It categorizes the various forms of exploitation, such as forcing children into prostitution
				or using them in pornography. Additionally, RA 7610 also addresses discrimination against children, including
				any act that deprives them of equal opportunities based on their race, gender, or social status.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				RA 7610 imposes severe penalties on individuals or institutions found guilty of violating children's rights. It
				empowers the government and related agencies to provide services such as rehabilitation, counseling, and legal
				assistance to abused children. The law represents the Philippines' strong commitment to protecting children’s
				welfare and ensuring that their rights are upheld in all aspects of society.
