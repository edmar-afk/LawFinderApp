				Republic Act No. 9262, also known as the "Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004," is a
				Philippine law designed to protect women and their children from various forms of abuse. It addresses physical,
				sexual, psychological, and economic violence, aiming to ensure the safety, dignity, and well-being of those
				affected. This law applies to women, whether married or in a relationship, and their children, whether
				legitimate or illegitimate. It outlines penalties for offenders, which include imprisonment and fines, and
				provides for protective measures such as restraining orders to prevent further harm. The law also mandates that
				government agencies and NGOs offer support services like legal assistance, shelter, and counseling to victims,
				promoting a society free from violence.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				The law provides several legal remedies for victims. Courts can issue protection orders, prohibiting the abuser
				from contacting or approaching the victim. Offenders can face imprisonment and fines depending on the severity
				of the abuse, making it a strong deterrent against violence.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4">
				In addition to legal penalties, the law mandates that government agencies and NGOs provide essential support
				services for victims. This includes offering shelters, legal assistance, and counseling to ensure their safety
				and recovery. Through these measures, RA 9262 aims to foster a society free from violence and abuse.
